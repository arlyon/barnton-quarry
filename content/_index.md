The Barnton Quarry Restoration Project is a volunteer-led effort to
restore Edinburgh's ROTOR R4 bunker to its original state, reversing
the years of decay and vandalism that affected it in the years after
it was decomissioned. The final goal is to open the historical bunker
to the public as an open learning space as well as an interactive
exhibition of the nuclear arms race leading up to and during the Cold
War.

Hoping to return it to its original R4 configuration, the team is
busy delicately removing and restoring everything from ventilation
to telephone switching stations. The project is primarily managed
by volunteers.

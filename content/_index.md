The Barnton Quarry Restoration Project is a volunteer-led effort to
restore Edinburgh's ROTOR R4 bunker to its original state, reversing
the years of decay and vandalism that affected it in the years after
it was decomissioned. The final goal is to open the historical bunker
to the public as an open learning space as well as an interactive
exhibition of the nuclear arms race leading up to and during the Cold
War.

Hoping to return it to its original R4 configuration, the team is
busy delicately removing and restoring everything from ventilation
to telephone switching stations.

## History

RAF Barnton Quarry, 4 miles from the city centre of Edinburgh and buried
deep under Corstorphine Hill, has a long association with the RAF which
dates back to the formation of the 3603 Fighter Control Unit of the
famous 603 (City of Edinburgh) Squadron during WWII. After WWII, the UK
government identified Russia as a key threat to national security and
the deep bunker at Barnton Quarry was built in 1952 as the response to
that threat. Operating as the Sector Operations Centre for co-ordinating
RAF fighter response to UK airspace intrusion, the staff at RAF Barnton
Quarry protected Scotland from attack by Russian long-range nuclear
bombers up until around 1960.

The theme was very much command and control, with radar sites stretching
from the very north of Scotland
right down to Northumberland (including our other bunker/museum,
Scotland’s Secret Bunker, RAF Troywood near Anstruther) reporting radar
contacts to Barnton Quarry via dedicated telephone lines, where the
information was triangulated and subsequently plotted on huge map tables
for RAF fighter commanders to view and make decisions regarding the
fighter response. The scale of the RAF operation here was astonishing;
the central operations well is vast and exists over three floors deep
underground. The bunker was specifically designed to withstand Russian
attack. It's buried 100ft underground with walls of 10ft thick
reinforced concrete, tank-metal blast doors, generators and a complex
air conditioning and filtration system. The site is of great historical
importance as it is the only surviving example of this type of bunker
in the UK which retains the original RAF three-level operations room.

Sadly, the bunker has been neglected for many years and has suffered
theft and fire damage. We plan to restore it exactly as it was under the
RAF in 1952 and open the site as a museum so that visitors can
experience it first-hand for themselves. Our vision is to leverage
interactive technology to create rotating exhibits, all relevant to the
teaching of RAF and Cold War history. The space we have on the site is
huge, hence we plan reserve a chunk of our display space to invite guest
exhibitors to display with the objective of providing new and interesting
display topics for returning visitors. Addiitonally, we’re planning to
create dedicated permanent displays to preserve the history of 603
squadron in the bunker which was home to the FCU!

We've been working
hard for the past six years to recover the site. We're making great
progress, but there is still a long way to go! Volunteers are the
lifeblood of what we're doing and we're very keen for volunteers to get
involved in the project. Any help is appreciated! Continue below to see
how to get involved.

# Your Bunker needs You!

Although we receive financial assistance from Scotland’s Secret Bunker
this is only enough to buy some of the materials for the restoration.
The only way we can hope to achieve our vision of a World Class Cold
War museum in Edinburgh is through the hard work and dedication of
our volunteers. Every weekend a small band of helpers give up their
free time to clean, clear, build, floor, plaster and paint their way
towards a finished bunker.

As well as those keen to learn new skills, we welcome existing trades,
although we can skim a wall, its nothing compared to what an
experienced plasterer can achieve! So if you have a skill that
you’re willing to bring to the Quarry, we’re all ears!
Even if you think that your skill is too esoteric for our project - try
us! We have miles of fence line to repair, brick walls to rebuild, an
acre or two of land to tame, a carpark to tarmac,… you get the idea!
We also realise that physical graft is not everyone’s cup of tea.
There are plenty of other tasks to assist with such as web design,
historical research and funding & sponsorship. If these pique your
interest, let us know.

# How Can my Business Help?

As well as volunteering, we always need materials to complete the
project. If you’re a merchant or a supplier and can help us out,
or, if you wish to talk to us about sponsorship, we would be happy
to talk to you about it.
